# 👋 Hey, I'm Sohail Khan

> Full‑Stack Dev ⚙️ • CSP‑Army Bug Hunter 🐛 • Service‑Mesh Whisperer 🎯 • JavaScript Polymath

I build stuff, break stuff, fix vulnerabilities—in that order. Passionate about **cybersecurity**, red‑teaming, bug‑hunting, and web apps built with **JS**, **React**, **Node**, and *occasional C/Python*.

## 🛠 Projects That Don’t Sleep

- **Chat App** – Real‑time messaging in plain JS: because typing “hello” never gets old.
- **SysWatch** – System monitoring tool in JS. Keeps an eye so your machine doesn’t yell at you.
- **GraphFlow** – React SPA to visualize and manage service mesh graphs with live data & drag‑drop UX.
- **ShareDaddy** – Instant text & file sharing, powered by plain ol’ Socket.io.

## 🔒 Cyber‑Security & Bug Hunting

Bug bounties? Pentests? Red‑team ops? Count me in.

Hunting down vulnerabilities and exploiting (ethically) is my adrenaline fix—whether in web apps, APIs, or Docker configs.
