# 👋 Hey, I'm Sohail Khan

> Full Stack Dev ⚡ • Retro‑Game Revivalist 🎮 • Graphics.js Guru 🖌️ • DNS Wrangler 🌐

I build cool stuff—sometimes over-engineered—mostly with **JavaScript**, **C**, **Python**, and a serious love for bug‑hunting and the red team life.

## 🛠 Projects That Don't Sleep

- **retro‑games** – Old-school classics (Nibbles, Space Invaders, Towers of Hanoi…) in Java, AS3 & JS.
- **graphics.js** – DIY drawing toolkit (lines/arcs/ellipses) so you can pretend to be Da Vinci in code.
- **DNSClient** – Lightweight C implementation of the DNS protocol, because why depend on system libs?

## 🧠 Cyber‑Stuff & Bug Hunting

Love that adrenaline when poking at systems and finding how they break.  
If you're into pentesting, red‑teaming, or bug bounties—I’m right there with you.

## 📡 Hit Me Up If...

- You're setting up a bug bounty hunt and want a partner – or someone to rant with.
- You need someone who’s debugged DNS in C, wrangled canvas graphics, or revived retro‑game code.
- You have a webapp with that *one weird vulnerability* and want it squashed (caffeine and dark humor included).
