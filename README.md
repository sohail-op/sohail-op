# 👋 Hey, I'm Sohail Khan

> Full‑Stack Dev ⚙️ • Socket.io Surgeon 🧠 • Cloud-native Minimalist ☁️ • Bug Hunter by Night 🐞

I'm a passionate builder, breaker, and debugger—equally at home crafting real-time apps as I am digging through source maps for security holes. I thrive at the intersection of web dev and cybersec (especially red teaming and bug bounty stuff).

## 🛠 Projects That Don’t Sleep

- **🟢 YAP** – A full-stack MERN chat app with live messaging, JWT auth, profile pics, and real-time user presence. Built with Next.js, Zustand, and Tailwind CSS. Think WhatsApp, but more developer therapy and less stickers.

- **📊 SysWatch** – A distributed system monitoring suite. 10 simulated clients push real-time process stats to a central server via Redis Pub/Sub. It's nerdy, modular, and useful when you want to know exactly how your machines are suffering.

- **📤 ShareDaddy** – Share text and files via short codes. Features R2-backed uploads, Redis caching, auto-expiry, rate-limiting, and a frontend that actually respects your screen size. Powered by Next.js 13+ and Express.

- **🔁 GraphFlow** – An interactive React Flow SPA for visualizing service mesh topology. Add/remove services, link them live, and manipulate nodes like you're designing a high-stakes subway map.

## 🔒 Cybersecurity & Bug Hunting

Into bug bounty? Red team ops? Same here. I enjoy poking around in web apps, APIs, and client-side JS for anything weird—and I usually find something.

Whether it’s CSP bypasses, misconfigured tokens, or that one missing `HttpOnly` flag... I’m hunting it.

## 📡 Reach Out If...

- You're building real-time apps and want help with sockets, scaling, or Redis magic.
- You’re looking to secure your frontend/backend (headers, JWTs, RCEs, the fun stuff).
- You want a teammate to nerd out over race conditions or auth bypasses at 2AM.

## 🎯 Life Motto

> “If it runs, monitor it. If it breaks, debug it. If it’s vulnerable—exploit it (then responsibly disclose).”
