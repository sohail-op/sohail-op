# 👋 Hey, I'm Sohail Khan

> Full Stack Developer ⚙️ • Graph Bender 🕸 • Redaction Whisperer 🕵️‍♂️ • Occasional Wi-Fi Driver Therapist 🛠️

I build secure, scalable, and sometimes over-engineered stuff. Mostly with **MERN**, **Next.js**, **Redis**, and **a mild caffeine addiction**.

## 🛠 Projects That Don't Sleep

- 🔴 **RE-DACT** – NLP-powered data redaction tool. Security so tight it redacts itself.  
- 📈 **Distributed System Monitor** – Real-time system stats, two clients, one Redis, zero patience.  
- 🧠 **CIS Audit Tool** – Automated scripts for Windows/Linux hardening, because clicking through GUIs is for masochists.  
- 🧰 **Tshare** – Instant file & text sharing with Socket.io. Like pastebin, but with more real-time sass.  
- 📊 **Kiali-inspired Graph SPA** – Because if your services aren't tangled in a React Flow, do they even exist?
