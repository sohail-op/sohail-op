# 👋 Hey, I'm Sohail Khan

> Full‑Stack Dev ⚙️ • Bug Hunter by Night 🐞

I build secure, scalable, and sometimes over-engineered stuff. Mostly with **MERN**, **Next.js**, **Redis**, and **a mild caffeine addiction**. Plus a serious love for bug‑hunting life..

## 🛠 Projects That Don’t Sleep

- **💬 YAP** – A full-stack MERN chat app with live messaging, JWT auth, profile pics, and real-time user presence. Built with Next.js, Zustand, and Tailwind CSS. Think WhatsApp, but more developer therapy and less stickers.

- **📊 SysWatch** – A distributed system monitoring suite. 10 simulated clients push real-time process stats to a central server via Redis Pub/Sub. It's nerdy, modular, and useful when you want to know exactly how your machines are suffering.

- **📤 ShareDaddy** – Share text and files via short codes. Features R2-backed uploads, Redis caching, auto-expiry, rate-limiting, and a frontend that actually respects your screen size. Powered by Next.js 13+ and Express.

- **🔁 GraphFlow** – An interactive React Flow SPA for visualizing service mesh topology. Add/remove services, link them live, and manipulate nodes like you're designing a high-stakes subway map.

## 🔒 Cybersecurity & Bug Hunting

- Love that adrenaline when poking at systems and finding how they break.
- If you're into pentesting, red‑teaming, or bug bounties—I’m right there with you.

## 📡 Ping Me If...

- You're setting up a bug bounty hunt and want a partner – or someone to rant with.
- You’re looking to secure your frontend/backend (headers, JWTs, RCEs, the fun stuff).
- You want a teammate to nerd out over race conditions or auth bypasses at 2AM.

## 🎯 Life Motto

> “If it runs, monitor it. If it breaks, debug it. If it’s vulnerable—exploit it (then responsibly disclose).”
